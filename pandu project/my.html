<p>FRIENDS<br>Being friends is about sharing our lives with others.There are some aspects of our lives that require that we spend a lot of time together or a lot of writing to help convey our feelings.<br>Other times sharing only a few words are more than adequate.<br>It is not always the long conversation that conveys the deepest feelings.<br>Sometimes,longer modes of expression may seem redundant and lacking in profundity.<br>Putting just the right combination of words on paper in a succinct style may just hit the spot.</p>
